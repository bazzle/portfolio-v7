It turns out a week in Wrocław is just about enough time to fall in love with the colour of its trams.

From morning coffee at the market hall to late night walks over the Oder, this trip was a gentle reset from London pace. The food scene is bold, the galleries cosy, and the people curious.

Expect a longer write up soon, but for now consider this a postcard: plan more impulsive travel, find more city squares to sit in, and always pack an extra notebook.
