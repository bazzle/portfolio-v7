While working on my personal rebrand, or to put it less pretentiously, _figuring out who I am, and what I do_, I got hung up on my job title for a while. I found that none of the existing titles that are conventionally recognised really capture what I do, so I invented my own one. I’m a _Web Design Tinkerer_ 

Instead of diving straight into what this is exactly, I will drop a few words and phrases that I think encapsulate being a design tinkerer.

Light-touch, less is more, iterate, kill your ego, pragmatism, agile, low-hanging-fruit, quick-wins, restraint, micro-interactions, embrace constraints, fundamentals, standards, don’t make me think, stay humble, we can’t know everything.

Fundamentally, a design tinkerer improves the user experience through optimising the _ feel_ of an app or the _rhythm_ of a website. Enhancing the interactivity and presentation of content—from a baseline of accessibility and tried and tested, but often overlooked conventional web standards, coupled with what I call _the subtle art of making things POP_—through the use of typography, hierarchy, colour, white-space, layout and the many other design fundamentals.

My approach centres around a few design philosophies and truths:

1. Good design is felt rather than noticed
2. Design is as much about what you take away as what you add
3. Small changes can make huge differences
4. A great design lands through iteration
5. Embrace constraints.

The verb I use, _to tinker_ encapsulates these philosophies pretty well, a website or app is like an old car, it’s modular and composable. A perfect medium to tinker with. The agile approach that is standard now in software development favours iteration and tinkering, as opposed to the linear waterfall approach where there’s definitive start and end states.

To tinker is to Identify how I can make small incremental changes for big improvements, embracing constraints and limitations, iterating, tweaking, testing and observing. This could be in the form of redesigning a website to give it more professional feel, a more consistent rhythm reflecting a new content strategy, optimising an interface for a newly identified user need or persona, adding some visual flourish and interactivity feedback to boost engagement and confidence or simply remediating some accessibility or usability issues.

The opposite of the tinkerer is what I call the design maximalist, the designer who always pitches for a fresh rebuild of a site, or a new feature of an app, which isn’t qualified by identifying the user need. The design maximalist  would try to achieve the impact the client is looking for on their website, through integrating design elements that are supposed to be used with restraint, to the massive detriment of the content, and the needs of the users. The design maximalist overlooks the fact that often it is the small, subtle changes that make the biggest impacts.

As a design tinkerer, I don’t shy away from redesigns and rebuilds if that is what’s necessary or desired. It’s not an absolute adherence to these philosophies, more of a mindset. A minimalist, functional design approach that asks what are the small iterable changes that can be made, which will result in the best outcomes.

In terms of design, I prioritise accessibility and user needs with a restrained use of visual and interactive enhancements, in line with The subtle art of making things POP. As a design tinkerer I’m perfectly positioned to deliver this to a product.

If you’d like to read on, I’ve included some examples of day-to-day tasks I carry out that are within the realm of Design Tinkerer:

- Working with the content designer, and/or the user researcher, the designer has created a set of mockups in figma, establishing the design direction, the look and feel and the alignment with the brand. I’m tasked with tinkering with this design to pull it closer to something the build team can turn into a website. Keeping in mind the constraints of project scope, accessibility and responsive behaviour and capturing the pitfalls that occur when a mockup, designed to impress the client, gets directly palmed off to the developer.
- I’m tasked with carrying out an accessibility audit on a website, upon completing the audit, I carry out remediations. Depending on scope, this could just be to address the WCAG violations or it could be to fix _best practice_ issues, which are clear accessibility issues that are outside the scope of WCAG guidelines.
- I join the build team in the final sprint of a new website build prior to launch. I’m tasked with fixing visual issues and bugs that were overlooked in the initial build of those components and patterns. This could be fixing spacing on a component, or ensuring consistent spacing between elements on a page template. The difference between the launched product not looking quite right, and looking professional and polished.
- An owner of a website for a local business, that hasn’t been touched for a number of years hires me to fix some visual and interactive bugs that prevents users from seeing content on a mobile device. Along with this, adding some POP and polish to an otherwise flat and uninspiring website.
