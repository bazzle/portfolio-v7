While working on my personal rebrand, or to put it less pretentiously, _figuring out who I am, and what I do_, I got hung up on what particular job title I can use that best captures me. I found that none of the existing titles which are conventionally recognised really fit. So I invented my own. I’m a _Web design tinkerer_

It’s not a job title per se, more a mindset and approach to work. A Web design tinkerer broadly covers UI design and front-end design engineering.

 As the name suggests, to tinker is to make the small changes. To iterate rapidly and refine over time. To set the scene, a few words to describe a Design tinkerer:

Light-touch, less is more, iterate, kill your ego, pragmatism, agile, low-hanging-fruit, restraint, embrace constraints, fundamentals, standards, stay humble, we can’t know everything.

The approach of the design tinkerer centres around a few design philosophies and truths:

1. Good design is _felt_ rather than noticed
2. Design is as much about what you take away as what you add
3. Small changes can make huge differences
4. A great design lands through iteration.

The verb I use, _to tinker_ encapsulates these philosophies pretty well, a website or app is like an old car, it’s made up of modular and composable parts. A perfect medium to tinker with, to add to, to take away from, to modify, to refactor, retest and review. 

The Design tinkerer can work for any design discipline, but it works particularly well for web design. Unlike, for example Interior design—where the designer can only tinker during the initial design and ideation stage, not after the interior has been installed, The impermanence of digital products allows for ongoing design iteration as more is understood about user needs and how they interact with the product. The agile mindset favours tinkering.

It is important to emphasise that, to describe the Design tinkerer as being exclusively concerned with the small changes is a misnomer. It is not the small change to achieve a certain goal, it is the _smallest_ change, which might be in itself a relatively large change. This is all to say that the Design tinkerer wouldn’t shy away from suggesting a website redesign, for example if that is the most appropriate course of action.

As a Web design tinkerer, with a focus on the look and feel of interfaces, I figure out the small changes that can make the biggest impacts and best outcomes. From a baseline of often overlooked conventional web standards and accessibility guidelines, I add minimal but impactful  visual and interactive flourish, along the lines of what I call_The subtle art of making things POP_—the use of typography, hierarchy, colour, white-space, layout and other design fundamentals.

A web design tinkerer rejects the assumption that big changes must be made to achieve the big impacts a client is asking for. To outline how this works in practical terms, here are some examples:

**A website redesign to go with a new content strategy** I’d question if a redesign is necessary, a _refresh_ might be more appropriate. I seek to figure out how I can present the new content as well as possible with what already exists. An adjustment of a single font property and a few styling rules—loosening that line-height, reducing the line-length, or increasing the white-space might make a massive improvement to the presentation of content on a web page.

**Optimising an interface for a newly identified user need or persona** I’d find a way to satisfy the need without introducing new screens and user journeys, only doing so if necessary. This way, the product evolves slowly in response to changing user needs.

**Improving the usability of an interface off the back of an accessibility audit** Simply remediating WCAG violations, improves the interface for everybody, not just for users with disabilities. From this baseline I can address instances where best practices haven’t been applied.

**A fresh new build** If tasked with building a new website or app, I’d be mindful to allow separation of concerns, to make possible design tinkering further down the line, small changes to the code to make big differences. This could be in the form of global styling, separate from component-level. The data and content separate from the presentation layer.
