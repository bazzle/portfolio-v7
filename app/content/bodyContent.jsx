					I have experience in many phases of development, with varying levels of involvement within Agile and Kanban development teams. I create wireframes, build mockups and interactive prototypes, assist user research sessions, facilitate collaborative design sessions and work with other developers in production build. I also carry out accessibility audits using automated tools and manual testing. I primarily build websites using WordPress that use either the classic or the Gutenburg block editor.

					I‘ve also been exploring building websites and apps using vanilla JS and frameworks such as React + NextJS and Vue + Nuxt.js. I am adaptable and a fast learner to different tech stacks.

				I am looking for a job where I have the opportunity to both use my existing experience and diversify my current skill-set by tackling new things, as I firmly believe in learning by doing. I try to avoid environments that impose rigid specialisation, preferring flexibility to an extent. My perfect employer would be a small to medium sized organisation that creates value by doing something innovative and perhaps against the mould. I am passionate about new technologies and paradigms. Decentralised protocols such as Bitcoin and Nostr interest me greatly.
